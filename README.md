# course-choices-CF

## Disclaimer 

This project has been made to help fellow UCF schedulers trying to figure out whether a student has chosen two courses. It is very simple to use and as idiot proof as possible I think.

If you are coding more regularly I would recommend using a virtual environment. If you do then I am sure you know how to create one and you do not really the rest of the README. If you do not you can just skip the virtualenv part.


## How to use

### Prerequisites: 
*Python* 

First of all, this is a python program. To execute you need to download and install python. Please choose and download python3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions. 

*Pip*

Usually, pip is installed with python3. You can check it by typing "pip help" in the command line. However, if that is not the case consult [this website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) 

*Pandas*

Next, we need some basic libraries on which the program is based. For that you need to type "pip install pandas" or if it does not work "python3 -m pip install pandas". 

*Numpy*

Numpy should be installed if pandas is installed otherwise try "pip install numpy" or if it does not work "python3 -m pip install numpy"

*Tkinter*

Also, tkinter should be installed after installing python3. If that is not the case consult this [website](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-Tkinter)

*Let's go!* 

Finally, you can download the file "course.choices.py". In your terminal go to the folder (easy to google if you do not know how to) where you have saved it and type "python3 course.choices.py" or "py course.choices.py".
Alternatively, you can also click on the file and it starts the prgram or you click on "open with" and choose python3. 

No errors should occur (fingers crossed).
